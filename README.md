# Handwritten Digit Recognition using MNIST Dataset

This project allows users to draw a digit on a pop-up canvas and predicts the digit using a trained deep learning model.

## Features
- Train a CNN model using the MNIST dataset in Google Colab.
- Save and load the trained model.
- Open a drawing canvas using OpenCV to draw digits.
- Predict the drawn digit using the trained model.

  
## Files
- `notebooks/digit_recognition.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook/Gcolab for training the model.
- `model/digit_recognition64.h5` – Pretrained CNN model.
- `src/app.py` – OpenCV canvas for drawing and predicting digits.
- `requirements.txt` – Dependencies for the project.
